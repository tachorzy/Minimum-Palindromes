# Minimum-Palindromes
COSC 3320 HW2 Programming Challenge, Professor Wu

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like x, pop, noon, redivider. Any string can be broken into sequence of palindromes. For example, the string bubbaseesabanana (‘bubba sees a banana’) can be broken into palindromes in several different ways:
* bub baseesab anana
* b u bb a sees a b anana
* b u b b a s e e s a b a n a n a
Find the minimum number of palindromes that make up the given string
Input format: first line is a single number n, the following line consists of length n string (character array) that is the string A[1..n]
